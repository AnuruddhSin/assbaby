      BabyBliss is a demo-only baby products store built with MERN, PWA, GSAP and
      Framer Motion. It’s inspired by FirstCry.com and designed to feel like a
      polished startup e-commerce experience.

      This project is for learning and assessment only. No real payments or
      shipping happen here – but the experience mimics a modern baby care shop.
